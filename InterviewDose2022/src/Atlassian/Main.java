/***
 * Snake initial size = 3
 * every 5 steps it will increase = size + 1
 * Note: Game will end when snake hit itself.
 *
 * We can assume a boundary for it. like 5*5 (ex)
 * Directions can be assumed.
 *
 * Lets say board is of 5 * 5
 * board is combinations of boxes/cells .
 * 5 boxes as of now
 * each box might be empty or snake is passing through the box.
 * snake will be a list of boxes (in other words) initial = 3 cells
 * snake should be moving.
